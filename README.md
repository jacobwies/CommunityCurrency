# Community Currency Receptacle Monitoring

###### A project by DISC Northwestern

Community Currency is a non-profit start-up at Northwestern focused on collecting and donating foreign currencies that have no immediate value to those who acquired them abroad. Community Currency converts the money into American dollars and uses it to benefit those in need.

The purpose of this application is to collect data about monitoring receptacles in order to enable notifications and analysis to improve collection methods and process.
